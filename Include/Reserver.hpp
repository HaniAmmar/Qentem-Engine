/**
 * @file Reserver.hpp
 * @brief High-performance memory reservation system with zero internal metadata.
 *
 * This module implements Qentem's low-level allocator — Reserver — a deterministic,
 * reusable memory region manager built to replace traditional heap mechanisms
 * with precise, high-efficiency block control.
 *
 * Each memory block is divided and tracked via compact bit tables, avoiding
 * per-region metadata and ensuring tight memory boundaries. Allocations are aligned,
 * coalescible, and free of runtime headers. All tracking is external and
 * architecture-aware, making it ideal for systems with strict performance constraints.
 *
 * Reserver is designed for per-core use, with one instance per logical CPU to avoid
 * contention and preserve cache locality. Memory requests are routed to the current
 * core's arena, with optional cross-core fallback for safe reclamation. The system
 * supports NUMA-friendly placement and configurable block sizes for tuning.
 *
 * Features:
 *  - Zero internal metadata: allocations remain clean and unencumbered.
 *  - Bitfield-based region tracking for fast reuse and coalescence.
 *  - Per-core arenas for scalable, lock-free performance.
 *  - Fixed block sizing with fast first-fit region selection.
 *  - Supports `MemoryRecord` for usage tracking and debugging.
 *
 * @warning Not thread-safe. Intended for core-pinned, single-threaded use cases.
 * @note    Depends on MemoryBlock and LiteArray. Behavior customizable via macros.
